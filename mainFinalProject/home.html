    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <div class="text">
        <p> 
            In order to answer our questions about the effects of gaming on life satisfaction, let's look at the biggest openly available dataset collected by Marian Sauter and Dejan Draschkow.
            <a href="https://osf.io/vnbxk/wiki/home/" style="color:rgb(33, 33, 105);">You can access the original dataset here. </a>
        </p>

        <p> Although the dataset consists of over 13000 gamers from 109 countries of different age groups, I would like to focus on a certain subset of the data. As for data cleaning, I have removed responses which have values of "Not Applicable" so that
            I can do the relevant analyses. I have also filtered out the responses that are too unrealistic (e.g., 8000 hours of gameplay per week). Therefore, the main question of my analysis of this study would be: 
            
            <p style="color:rgb(33, 33, 105)">Is there a negative impact of number of gaming hours per week on life satisfaction of League of Legends youth gamers? </p>
        </p>
        
        <hr width= "90%" color="rgb(33, 33, 105)">

        <h4> What is League of Legends? </h4>
        <p> League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as <i>League</i>, is an online multiplayer battle arena game by RiotGames. Players gather to fight each other in teams, with games ranging from 15 minutes to 40 minutes on average. Since there is no limit to the number of games you can play,
        and there are plenty of characters (also known as <i>champions</i>) to pick from, one would find themselves moving from game to game without rest. The contents of the game might be the same, but the people you play with are always different, which result in different battle experiences. Therefore,
        one would not get tired of it easily and can play for hours. </p>

        <p>I personally have an interest in this game and have also played for hours in a day before. Therefore, I thought that it would be interesting to dive into the effects of excessive gaming on life satisfaction. </p>

<div class="section" id="section5" style="background-color:rgb(107, 107, 192)">

        Here is the world map which depicts the average number of hours per week of each country, as well as the corresponding life satisfaction score. Here we can also see which countries have higher average gaming hours, by looking at the shade of colours.

<div class="section" id="section6" style="background-color:rgb(192, 107, 140)">

    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="text">
        <p> I foresee a look of confusion on your face, <t class="name"></t> Indeed, I was very surprised to see that there is such a low correlation between average number of gaming hours per week and average life satisfaction. </p>
            
        <p>What does this mean? Do we merely just conclude that there is a low correlation between gaming and life satisfaction? Is this the end?

            <p>Maybe let's take a look at the survey participant demographics to see if we can find something. How about we examine the various regions instead?</p>

        <p> It seems that the survey participant demographics aren't evenly spread out. Instead, we see a concentration of participants from the North America and Europe region. </p>

        <p> As we can see, the correlation values of different regions <area shape="circle" coords="" href="" alt=""> still pretty low. 
            
        <p>I'm wondering if you noticed something different, <t class="name"></t>
        Africa's scatter plot is showing that there is a positive correlation between average number of gaming hours and life satisfaction! </p>

        <p> Hmmm.... But as we saw <a href="#section7" style="color:lightpink;">before</a>, the number of participants from Africa is only 39, and this might not be very representative of the population that we seek to explore.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section" id="section9" style="background-color:rgb(73, 58, 11)"> 
    <h1>Why do we still have low correlation?</h1>
    <div class="text">
        <p> Although the dataset claims to be the biggest dataset, it might not be the most accurate in showing a correlation between gaming and life satisfaction. Why? This is because there are many biases in the dataset, as well as the data collection methods.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Collection Method</h3>
        <p>Because of the sheer scale of the survey, it is very hard to ensure that there is random sampling, which allows for an equal representation of the population. As such, the survey was posted on Reddit, hence most of the participants are users of Reddit. Also, the participants are generally skewed towards males from North America and Europe. </p>
        
        <!-- insert table of data -->
        <h3>Extraneous variables</h3>
        <p>We also cannot discount the fact that life satisfaction is caused by a various number of other factors like social-economic status, race, education level, and more. Therefore, with there being lots of noise in the dataset, it is natural that a strong correlation cannot be found.</p>

<div class="section" id="section10" style="background-color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> 
    <h1>Concluding Thoughts</h1>
    <div class="text">
        <p> Even though the correlation that we have established between the average number of gaming hours and life satisfaction is weak, we still do see a small decline. 
            This means that excessive amounts of gaming might be linked with life satisfaction. </p>

        <p>Future research can focus on narrowing the scope to establish a stronger correlation between the 2 variables, attempting to control for possible extraneous variables.
