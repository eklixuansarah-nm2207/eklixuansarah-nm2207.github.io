            <p> Welcome to my website about gaming. Here I will be exploring the effects of gaming on life satisfaction.
                Are there many people who like to play games?
                Is excessive gaming really as bad as people think it is? Do we need to do something about it? 
            </p>
            <!-- use of a random letter 't' to indicate that the area should be replaced with the user's name -->
            <p> Firstly, let's talk about you, <t class="name"></t>
            </p>
            <h2>Do you like games?</h2>

                You keep telling yourself, <h2> <i>"Just one more time. Just 5 more minutes."</i></h2>
                When you come to your senses, two hours have gone by. Oh no! What now?
                <br>
                <h2>Many gamers often feel like this.</h2>
                According to Harvard Health, playing too many games can be negative for gamers, resulting in effects
                like diminished physical or psychological health (Grinspoon, 2020).
                And the fact that the gaming industry is designed to keep you enticed, to keep you playing, for it
                to earn revenue, doesn't make the situation any better... <br><br>
                <h3>Let's now take a look at how much gaming has penetrated countries worldwide; data collated by Statista!</h3>

            <p> Well, it seems that all the regions have pretty high gaming-penetration rates!
                This graph depicts the percentage of citizens in the region who play games, as of 2022. The world
                average percentage is 82%! <br><br>
                
                We know that gaming is prevalent worldwide, so it could pose a problem to lots of people. With such
                a huge amount of people
                playing games, it's inevitable that there are some people who play more than others. Maybe a little too
                much as well. <br><br>
                
                Could gaming affect life satisfaction? If you think about it, there are pros and cons to gaming. On one
                hand, you could be relaxed and take your mind off reality while gaming. But on the other hand, you could meet nasty people online
                (presuming it's an online multiplayer game), or you could lose precious time that could be spent on more meaningful or fulfiling
                things.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>
                In order to answer our questions about the effects of gaming on life satisfaction, let's look at the
                biggest openly available dataset collected by Marian Sauter and Dejan Draschkow.
                <!-- link to access original data -->
                <a href="https://osf.io/vnbxk/wiki/home/" style="color:lightpink">You can access the original dataset here. </a>
            </p>
            
            <p> Although the dataset consists of over 13000 gamers from 109 countries of different age groups, I would
                like to focus on a certain subset of the data. As for data cleaning, I have removed responses which have
                values of "Not Applicable" so that
                I can do the relevant analyses. I have also filtered out the responses that are too unrealistic (e.g.,
                8000 hours of gameplay per week). Therefore, the main question of my analysis of this study would be:
            
                <p style="color:rgb(252, 252, 254)">Is there a negative impact of number of gaming hours per week on life
                satisfaction of League of Legends youth gamers? </p>
            </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h1>First... What is League of Legends? </h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p> League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as <i>League</i>, is an online multiplayer battle arena
                game by RiotGames. Players gather to fight each other in teams, with games ranging from 15 minutes to 40
                minutes on average. Since there is no limit to the number of games you can play,
                and there are plenty of characters (also known as <i>champions</i>) to pick from, one would find
                themselves moving from game to game without rest. The contents of the game might be the same, but the
                people you play with are always different, which result in different battle experiences. Therefore,
                one would not get tired of it easily and can play for hours.<br><br>

                I personally have an interest in this game and have also played for hours in a day before. (The video
                you saw at the start of this website is a video of my League of Legends gameplay!) Therefore, I
                thought that it would be interesting to dive into the effects of excessive gaming on life satisfaction.

        <h1>World Map for Gaming Hours and Life Satisfaction</h1>
        <div class="text">
            This interactive world map depicts the average number of gaming hours per week of each country, as well as their
            corresponding average life satisfaction score. Here we can also see which countries have higher average gaming
            hours, by looking at the shade of colours. The darker the shade of red, the higher the average amount of gaming hours.
        </div>
    
        <div id="mapchart"></div>
    
        <div class="text">
            A quick scan through the map tells us that most countries seem to be in the 20s range for their average number of gaming hours per week. This translates to roughly at least 3 hours a day on average!
            Life satisfaction seems to be generally hovering around the 18s to 20s, whereas the maximum score is 35. Now that we are seeing all these values, how do we make sense of it? 
            
            <h3>Does increased gaming translate to lower life satisfaction?</h3>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="section8">
        <h1> Let's look at the correlation between the two factors!</h1>

        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <p> I foresee a look of confusion on your face, <t class="name"></t> Indeed, I was very surprised to see
                that there is such a low correlation between average number of gaming hours per week and average life
                satisfaction for the entire world. <br><br>
                From just the points itself, we are unable to really see any clear direction of points. The trendline formed shows a narrow decrease in life satisfaction as gaming hours per week increase.
                <h3>What does this mean? Do we merely just conclude that there is a low correlation between gaming and life
                satisfaction? Is this the end?</h3>
            </p>
        </div>

    <div class="section" id="section9">
        <div class="text">
            <h1>No! We cannot stop here, <t class="name"></t></h1>
            <p>Maybe let's take a look at the survey participant demographics to see if we can find something. How about
                we examine the various regions instead? Breaking down our data can help us see if it is representative of 
                the population we wish to explore, or perhaps even find new patterns!

        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="text">
            <p> It seems that the survey participant demographics aren't evenly spread out. Instead, we see a
                concentration of participants from the North America and Europe region. This could be due to the fact that most 
                participants were sourced from Reddit, which might have a larger proportion of users coming from certain regions... <br><br>
                Let's now take a closer look into the correlation between gaming and life satisfaction by regions!

                As we can see, the trendline slopes still do not seem to improve very much for the individual regions... 
                They all remain quite flat, which perhaps could mean that there isn't really much correlation between gaming and life satisfaction...? <br><br>
                However, I'm wondering if you noticed something different, <t class="name"></t>
                Africa's scatter plot is showing that there is a positive correlation between average number of gaming
                hours and life satisfaction! This is something called the Simpson's Paradox, whereby the main trendline of the entire data 
                differs after you break the data into different groups. Could this mean that higher amount of gaming is beneficial for people in the Africa region?
                 <!-- allows user to go back to the section with the mentioned chart -->
                Hmmm.... But as we saw <a href="#section10" style="color:lightpink;">before</a>, the number of
                participants from Africa is only 39, and this might not be very representative of the country.

    <div class="section" id="section12">
        <h1>Why do we still have low correlation?</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p> Although the dataset claims to be the biggest dataset, it might not be the most accurate in showing a
                correlation between gaming and life satisfaction. Why? This is because there are many biases in the
                dataset, as well as the data collection methods.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Collection Method</h3>
            <p>Because of the sheer scale of the survey, it is very hard to ensure that there is random sampling, which
                allows for an equal representation of the population. Since Reddit seems to be a platform where many gamers over the world 
                gather to discuss gameplay, the survey was posted on Reddit. Hence, we saw that
                most of the participants are users of Reddit, as compared to other platforms. Also, the participants are generally skewed towards males
                from North America and Europe. This results in a sampling bias.
            </p>
            <h3>Extraneous variables</h3>
            <p>We also cannot discount the fact that life satisfaction is correalted with a various number of other factors
                like social-economic status, race, education level, and more. Therefore, with there being lots of noise
                in the dataset, it is natural that a strong correlation cannot be found, unless we can control for the other variables.
            </p>
            <h3>Of course, there could still be the possibility of gaming hours not being very negatively correlated with life satisfaction. However, it is hard to come
                to a conclusion based on the current flawed data. 
            </h3>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="section13">
        <h1>Concluding Thoughts</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p> Even though the correlation that we have established between the average number of gaming hours and life
                satisfaction is weak, we still do see a small decline.
                This means that EXCESSIVE amounts of gaming might still be linked with life satisfaction. Therefore, it's always good to take note 
                of your gaming hours and how gaming makes you feel.
            </p>
            <p> Future research can focus on narrowing the scope to see if a stronger correlation between the two
                variables can be established. Perhaps a collaboration between researchers from over the world can be done. This would make it easier
                to get a more representative sample. Researchers should also attempt to control for possible extraneous variables.
